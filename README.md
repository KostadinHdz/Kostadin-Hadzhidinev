# About Me

I'm but a humble junior artist that wants to study. Right now I'm focusing on learning how to draw digitally and exploring different software to create assets that can be used in games. When I have free time I like to draw(preferably with pencils for now) and I also enjoy creating mods for games using different editors. I like to draw character concepts, real life people and some other characters I've met throughout gaming and watching movies.

For the moment my goal is to expand my artist skillset by learning how to work with different popular programs.
